# Vehicle-Speed-Tracker

Vehicle speed detector that uses OpenCV and Kalman Filters to detect and track cars from a traffic cam livestream. Once a car passes a certain distance, its speed is calculated and checked against the speed limit. If the speed exceeds the limit, an image is saved, showing both the speeding car and its speed.
